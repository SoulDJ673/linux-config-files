#Zsh Config
This directory contains the .oh-my-zsh directory and .zshrc configuration file that I use consistantly across my machines.

1. Rename both oh-my-zsh and zshrc to the same names, but with a . preceeding both.
2. Move everything in this directory to /home/$USER/
3. Make sure zsh is installed.  All new zsh instances should be working with my custom configuration.
